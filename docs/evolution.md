# Project Evolution

## Phase 1: Console Todo App
- In-memory Python console application
- Built using spec-driven development with Claude Code
- Reusable agents and skills in .claude/
- All source code preserved in /legacy/phase1-console/
- Demonstrates basic CRUD operations via CLI

## Phase 2: Full-Stack Web Application
- Modern multi-user web app
- Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend
- Neon PostgreSQL database
- Secure authentication with Better Auth + JWT
- All new code in /frontend and /backend
- Phase 1 code untouched and preserved for comparison

This clear separation shows the evolution from simple script to cloud-ready full-stack system.
