# Phase 1 History

## Core Prompts and Features

Phase 1 of the CLI Todo application focused on building a console-based task management system with essential features:

### Initial Setup and Architecture
- Created a spec-driven architecture for the todo application
- Set up project structure with proper separation of concerns
- Implemented configuration management and documentation

### Core Todo Functionality
- **Add Task**: Ability to add new tasks with descriptions and metadata
- **View Tasks**: List all tasks with status indicators and details
- **Mark Complete**: Update task completion status
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the system

### Data Persistence
- Implemented JSON-based persistence for task storage
- Created a robust data model for task management
- Designed a file-based storage system for local task persistence

### User Interface
- Developed a console-based interactive interface
- Created clear command structure for task operations
- Implemented user-friendly prompts and feedback mechanisms

### Advanced Features
- Added due dates and priority levels for tasks
- Implemented task categorization and filtering
- Created rich UI elements for better user experience

### Technical Implementation
- Used Python for the backend implementation
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Created a modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Ensured proper data validation and persistence mechanisms

## Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented a complete CLI-based todo application
- Created a well-documented, spec-driven architecture
- Established a foundation for future enhancements and features
- Implemented robust data persistence using JSON files
- Created an intuitive user interface for task management
